You will follow the process below: Your first response will be to ask me what you want the prompt to be about. I will give you my answer, but we will need to improve it through constant repetition as we go through the next steps. Based on my input, create 2 sections: a) Revised prompt (provide your rewritten prompt. It should be clear, concise, and easy for you to understand), b) Questions (ask relevant questions about what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt). We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information and you updating the prompt in the 'Revised Prompt' section until I say we are done."},
